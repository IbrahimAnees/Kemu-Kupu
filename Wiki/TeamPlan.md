Team plan  
To create the quiz module for Kēmu Kupu to enable users to practice spelling te reo Māori words.

Kēmu Kupu should have an opening GUI where the user can select one of two options  
- The Games module  
- Quit.  

Games Module  
The user selects the topic they want to their spelling list to be created from 

Let’s make separate files for each word categories

Main Menu
- Game button
- Quit button??? 
- Setting button? Slider? (for speech speed)

Just one game module
- Label to show the hint 
- Button to replay the sound
- Scoring system 

Scenes:
- Home scene
- Settings (pop up window)
- Select options/theme of words
- Actual quiz
- Score at the end
